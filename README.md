work with npm and javascript .

packages:
live-server
lodash
browserify

install lodash and browserify

to import and use lodash we just use this command in javascript:

var _ = require("lodash");

and should browserify script.js file to boundle.js file and pass the boundle.js file to html

npm && package.json :

npm init ==> make an package.json for project localy.

npm install ==> prepare all dependencies in .json file ready and download it if it missed.

"scripts" in .json file ==> we can write scripts and run those with this command : npm run <script name>
